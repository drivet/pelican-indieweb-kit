# Pelican Indieweb Kit

This project provides some of the pieces required to make a [pelican][1] based website/blog more [indieweb][2] friendly.  It consists of several components:

* A Flask application providing [webmention][3], [micropub and media server][4] endpoints.
* A collection of pelican plugins to send and show webmentions in general, and to interface with [bridgy][5] in particular.
* A pelican theme designed to display the different types of posts one might expect of an indieweb site, as well as webmentions.
